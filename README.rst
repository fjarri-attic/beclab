Trapped BEC simulator

============
Introduction
============

This module is used for simulating the behavior of BEC (one- or two-component) in a magnetic trap.
Currently it supports common GPEs and coupling pulses; work on quasiprobability methods
(Wigner representation, in particular) is still in progress.
Simulation results can be saved as YAML files or several types of graphs;
see reference for details.
